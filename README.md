# Ranutils
## The random utils that are almost good

### What are ranutils?
Ranutils are random programs are made that do one thing, and one thing ~~well~~ bad.
### Why are these on github?
They might be bad, but they might be useful to someone I guess (and hope).
### How compile?
Either run `mkall.sh`, or manually `cc` the programs.
Compilation instructions for them can be found in their folder's readme.
### Why are you using a custom script instead of a Makefile?
Because im too stupid to write makefiles, and makefiles barely work on anything that isnt gmake
and gmake bad because its gnu (yes yes)
### License?
[WTFPL](https://wtfpl.net/txt/copying/)[+N](https://plusnigger.autism.exposed) for all. If you are a company and *dont* want to include the n-word on your website,
contact me and you might get a normal(ish) license.
### OMG guys he used the +N license hes ***RACIST***
no i just hate big companies and the +n makes them seethe
### Can i get a list of programs?
sure

| program name: | what it does                     |
|---------------|----------------------------------|
| tripcode      | generates 4chan tripcodes        |
| progresscopy  | `cp` but outputs progress        |
| passgen       | generates a password, fancy-ish  |
| splay         | shitty music player in sdl and c |

also more will be added later
### I wanna contribute
***DO NOT FUCKING PR.*** Pull requests are a propriatery extension to git, which means
that they are the spawn of evil, and created by ~~macromedia~~ microsoft. If you wanna
contribute code, **format a patch and email it to `flandre@duck.com`.**
### I wanna contribute (without adding code)
Aight just open an issue i guess
