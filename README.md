# Ranutils
## The random utils that arent good enough to go into uwutools but arent bad enough to stay on my hdd forever

### What are ranutils?
Ranutils are random programs are made that do one thing, and one thing ~~well~~ bad. They
arent good enough to deserve the title of an uwuToolâ„¢.
### Why are these on github?
They might be bad, but they might be useful to someone I guess (and hope).
### License?
[WTFPL](https://wtfpl.net/txt/copying/)[+N](https://plusnigger.autism.exposed) for all. If you are a company and *dont* want to include the n-word on your website,
contact me and you might get a normal(ish) license.
### OMG guys he used the +N license hes ***RACIST***
no i just hate big companies and +n makes them seethe
### Can i get a list of programs?
sure

| program name: | what it does                    |
|---------------|---------------------------------|
| tripcode      | generates 4chan tripcodes       |
| progresscopy  | `cp` but outputs progress       |
| passgen       | generates a password, fancy-ish |

also more will be added later
### I wanna contribute
***DO NOT FUCKING PR.*** Pull requests are a propriatery extension to git, which means
that they are the spawn of evil, and created by ~~macromedia~~ microsoft. If you wanna
contribute code, **format a patch and email it to `flandre@duck.com`.**
### I wanna contribute (without adding code)
Aight just open an issue i guess
